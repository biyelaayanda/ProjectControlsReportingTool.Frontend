# PWA Implementation Test

## Test PWA Installation

1. **Build the application**:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Serve the application** (use a local server):
   ```bash
   npx http-server dist/ProjectControlsReportingTool.Frontend -p 8080
   ```

3. **Test PWA Features**:
   - Open Chrome/Edge and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`
   - Check DevTools > Application > Service Workers
   - Check DevTools > Application > Manifest
   - Look for the "Install App" button in the address bar
   - Test offline functionality by going offline in DevTools

## PWA Features Implemented

✅ **Service Worker Registration** - Automatic registration on app start
✅ **Web App Manifest** - Complete manifest.json with app metadata
✅ **Install Prompt Component** - User-friendly installation interface
✅ **Offline Capabilities** - Basic caching for core resources
✅ **App Icons** - PWA icons in multiple sizes (192x192, 512x512)
✅ **Standalone Mode Detection** - Detects when running as installed app
✅ **Push Notification Infrastructure** - Ready for backend integration

## Next Steps for PWA Enhancement

1. **Connect to Backend Push Notifications** - Integrate with existing push notification API
2. **Enhanced Offline Support** - Cache API responses for offline report viewing
3. **Background Sync** - Queue report submissions when offline
4. **Update Notifications** - Notify users of new app versions
5. **App Shortcuts** - Quick actions from installed app icon

## Production Deployment Notes

- HTTPS is required for PWA features in production
- Service worker caching should be configured for production assets
- App store submission possible for enhanced distribution
